### WaM-DaM Workshop 

We provide the instructions on how a user can set up a SQLite instance of WaM-DaM and use Mozzile FireFox Manager to visualize and interact with the WaM-DaM database. I explain the how to set up a SQLite database in this Youtube demonstration video. if you follow the instructions, the estimated time to setup a SQLite instance and create WaM-DaM blank instance is less than 15 miutes.

#### Software needed:
1. Download Mozilla FireFox web browser
https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/

2.	SQLite Manager Add-on to Mozilla FireFox
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/sqlite-manager/

3. Download the Pre-populated WaMDaM instance here

4. Queries     
i.  Check out the WEAP data structure using this [query](https://github.com/amabdallah/WaM-DaM/blob/master/Files/WorkshopQuries2/01CheckWEAPdataStructure.sql) 
This query shows the data structure of Object Types and their Attributes 
for Water Evaluation and Assessment (WEAP) model.    
Users can see the Objects, their topology, and their Attributes that WEAP uses 
to model water systems. These Object and Attributes are used as input to queries 
to search and discover water management data in other data structures   

ii. Available data to expand the Lower Bear River Model     
iii.Identify missing data to expand  the WEAP model     
iv. Discover available data for a WEAP model in the Tuscaloosa Region
