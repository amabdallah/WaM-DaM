### SQLite Instructions 

We provide the instructions on how a user can set up a SQLite instance of WaM-DaM and use Mozzile FireFox Manager to visualize and interact with the WaM-DaM database. I explain the how to set up a SQLite database in this Youtube demonstration video. if you follow the instructions, the estimated time to setup a SQLite instance and create WaM-DaM blank instance is less than 15 miutes.
