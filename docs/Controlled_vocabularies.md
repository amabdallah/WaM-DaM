### Controlled vocabularies

Controlled vocabularies (CVs) are terms that are adopted with clear definitions to enforce the use of consistent terminology for data fields across disciplines. In WaM-DaM, names of attributes and objects are controlled to maintain consistency across multidisciplinary data and users

#### CVS on WaM-DaM's Core Strucutre 

##### DataStructureDomain
A <a href="http://amabdallah.github.io/WaM-DaM/tables/CVs_DataStructureDomain.html" target="_blank">data structure domain</a>
helps user discover data structures that share a common domain (e.g., water supply, wastewater collection, storm water)	


##### CommonObjectTypes
A <a href="http://amabdallah.github.io/WaM-DaM/tables/CVs_CommonObjectTypes.html" target="_blank">CommonObjectTypes</a>
are controlled vocabulary for Object types like Reservoir which maps out to native object types like dam, reservoir, and waterbody	

##### CommonObjectCategory
A <a href="http://amabdallah.github.io/WaM-DaM/tables/CVs_CommonObjectTypes.html" target="_blank">CommonObjectCategory</a> Controlled vocabulary for objects common object types to organize them into hierarchal categories like supply and demand categories	

##### CommonAttributes
A <a href="http://amabdallah.github.io/WaM-DaM/tables/CVs_CommonObjectTypes.html" target="_blank">CommonAttributes</a> Controlled vocabulary for attributes like Volume which maps out to native attributes like capacity, vol, and storage		

##### CommonAttributeCategory
A <a href="http://amabdallah.github.io/WaM-DaM/tables/CVs_CommonObjectTypes.html" target="_blank">CommonAttributeCategory	</a> Controlled vocabulary for common attributes to organize them into hierarchal categories like Hydropower categories

##### Units
A <a href="http://amabdallah.github.io/WaM-DaM/tables/CVs_Units.html" target="_blank">unit </a>
refers to the dimension of data values of a quantitative attribute, help users unambiguously interpret the meaning of data values. Qualitative attributes like a “dam owner name” have no unit. The Units table applies to the Attributes table in WaM-DaM Core and enforces the same unit for all attributes across the instances of an Object to meet the consistency of units in particular Data Structure as used in modeling.	

##### InstanceStatus
A <a href="http://amabdallah.github.io/WaM-DaM/tables/CVs_InstanceStatus.html" target="_blank">Instance Status </a> is a controlled vocabulary (e.g., existing, proposed, past existed, and planned).
