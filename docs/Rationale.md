NSF Award Number: [1135482](http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1135482)

[CI-WATER Proposal](https://github.com/amabdallah/WaM-DaM/blob/master/Files/WIKI/CI-WATER_Proposal.pdf)

An interdisciplinary team of Utah and Wyoming researchers has received a $6 million, three-year award from the National Science Foundation (NSF) to develop a better understanding of the interconnectivity of natural and human water resources systems â€“ a critical environmental sustainability problem facing both Western states.

The award will allow the team of researchers to develop high-performance computer modeling and computational resources (known as cyberinfrastructure or CI for short) to simulate and study how factors such as population growth, shifting land uses and climate variability will impact water storage and availability in the Intermountain West. This award is made under the NSF Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), which supports states' efforts to enhance research, science and mathematics education, and workforce development.
 
The CI-WATER project includes researchers from Brigham Young University, the University of Utah, Utah State University, and the University of Wyoming. BYU and the University of Wyoming are the lead institutions for their respective states in the consortium.
