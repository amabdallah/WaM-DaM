## Rationale and Context

### Rationale
The developemnt of WaM-DaM is part of an ambitious research project to develop cyberinfrastructure to advance the science of hydrology and water managemet. The project is called “Cyber-Infrastructure to Advance High Performance Water Resource Modelling” (CI-WATER) http://ci-water.org. The CI-WATER Project is funded by the National Science Foundation through grants EPS-1135482 and EPS-1135483. 
NSF Award Number: <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1135482" target="_blank">(1135482)</a>

<a href="https://github.com/amabdallah/WaM-DaM/blob/master/Files/WIKI/CI-WATER_Proposal.pdf" target="_blank">(CI-WATER Proposal)</a>

The CI-WATER project includes researchers from Brigham Young University, the University of Utah, Utah State University, and the University of Wyoming. BYU and the University of Wyoming are the lead institutions for their respective states in the consortium.

An interdisciplinary team of Utah and Wyoming researchers has received a $6 million, three-year award from the National Science Foundation (NSF) to develop a better understanding of the interconnectivity of natural and human water resources systems – a critical environmental sustainability problem facing both Western states.

The award will allow the team of researchers to develop high-performance computer modeling and computational resources (known as cyberinfrastructure or CI for short) to simulate and study how factors such as population growth, shifting land uses and climate variability will impact water storage and availability in the Intermountain West. This award is made under the NSF Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), which supports states' efforts to enhance research, science and mathematics education, and workforce development.
 
###Context
The timming, funds, expertise, and passion that are avaialabe for WaM-DaM development were incredible (it cannot get better :)). Along the way of WaM-DaM development, there has been  an incredable interest from National and International scientists and practioners in standarizing the way we communicate systems water management data. 

We were fortunate to discuss and the development of WaM-DaM with these research groups and agencies listed below. WaM-DaM and these projects complement each other and there is a big room for reall future collaboration. There are numerous opportunities for [future work](https://github.com/amabdallah/WaM-DaM/blob/master/docs/Future_Work) with many of these groups.We hope that our discussions with these groups continue so we can achieve our common goal of having a standard to communciate systems water management data.
