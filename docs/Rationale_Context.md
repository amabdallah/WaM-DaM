## Rationale and Context

### Rationale
The development of WaM-DaM is part of an ambitious research project to develop cyberinfrastructure to advance the science of hydrology and water management. The project is called “Cyber-Infrastructure to Advance High Performance Water Resource Modelling” <a href="http://ci-water.org" target="_blank">CI-WATER</a>. The CI-WATER Project is funded by the National Science Foundation through grants EPS-1135482 and EPS-1135483. The project comprises large interdisciplinary team of Utah and Wyoming researchers.

The CI-WATER project includes researchers from Brigham Young University, the University of Utah, Utah State University, and the University of Wyoming. The project has received a $6 million, three-year award from the National Science Foundation (NSF) to develop a better understanding of the interconnectivity of natural and human water resources systems – a critical environmental sustainability problem facing both Western states.

NSF Award Number: <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1135482" target="_blank">(1135482)</a>

The award will allow the team of researchers to develop high-performance computer modeling and computational resources (known as cyberinfrastructure or CI for short) to simulate and study how factors such as population growth, shifting land uses and climate variability will impact water storage and availability in the Intermountain West. This award is made under the NSF Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), which supports states' efforts to enhance research, science and mathematics education, and workforce development.
 
###Context
The timing, availability of funds, expertise, and passion for WaM-DaM development were incredible by all meaning. Along the way of WaM-DaM development, there has been an incredible interest from National and International scientists and practitioners in standardizing the way we communicate systems water management data. 

We were fortunate to discuss and the development of WaM-DaM with these research groups and agencies listed below. WaM-DaM and these projects complement each other and there is a big room for real future collaboration. There are numerous opportunities for [future work](https://github.com/amabdallah/WaM-DaM/edit/master/docs/Future_Work.md) with many of these groups. We hope that our discussions with these groups continue so we can achieve our common goal of having a standard to communicate systems water management data.
