### Future Work

The design of WaM-DaM is limited to experience drawn from the reviewed water data systems, used data sources, and demonstrated use cases. 

1. Future work can incorporate complex and unanticipated aspects of water management data as an improvement to the current design. There are several opportunities for future work that can build on WaM-DaM specifications. 

2. We will utilize WaM-DaM to develop scientific workflows to automate the process to identify available and relevant data for models, extract it, transform and reformat it, and serve it to models. 

3. Other opportunities for future work can develop comprehensive lists of controlled vocabularies and ontology for water resources management data like in Piasecki and Beran (2009) for point observations time series data. 

Future work also can use the WaM-DaM and controlled vocabularies in web-services to publish and share water management data. Future work can develop a plugin to HydroDesktop (Ames et al., 2012) to discover, download, and visualize water management data. There is also an opportunity to build software tools to interact with WaM-DaM database like the ODM data loading tools (Horsburgh et al., 2011). Future work could test and adapt WaM-DaM to organize interlinked systems data of water, energy, and food resources. These future work opportunities can improve WaM-DaM and make it useful to the broader community, water managers, consulting industry, and scientists.



Further developments and refinement to WaM-DaM needs engagement from the larger water resources community that is involved in the fields of systems analysis and hydroinformatics. This community is mostly represented at the Environmental & Water Resources Institute <a href="http://www.asce.org/environmental-and-water-resources-engineering/environmental-and-water-resources-institute/" target="_blank">(EWRI)</a> of the American Society of Civil Engineers, the Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of the Hydrologic Science Inc., ([CUAHSI](https://www.cuahsi.org/)), and the International Environmental Modelling & Software Society ([iEMSs](http://www.iemss.org/society/)). We invite these communities of scientists and users to engage in further testing to WaM-DaM and provide feedback to improve it. WaM-DaM can serve as a first step towards a standard to organize and communicate systems analysis water management data.
