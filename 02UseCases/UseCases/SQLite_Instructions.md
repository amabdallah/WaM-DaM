### SQLite Instructions 

We provide the instructions on how a user can set up a SQLite instance of WaM-DaM and use Mozzile FireFox Manager to visualize and interact with the WaM-DaM database. I explain the how to set up a SQLite database in this Youtube demonstration video. if you follow the instructions, the estimated time to setup a SQLite instance and create WaM-DaM blank instance is less than 15 miutes.

#### Software needed:

1. Download Mozilla FireFox web browser

2.	SQLite Manager Add-on to Mozilla FireFox

3. DDL script to creat blank WaM-DaM database for [SQLite](https://github.com/amabdallah/WaM-DaM1.0/blob/master/Files/BlankSchemas/WaM-DaM_for_SQLite.sql)

4. Matlab. You need to install the Database Toolbox which doesnt come with the standartd Matlab software. You also can use Python, R, or any scripting language to load data to your database. 

5. Download SQLite *[Optional]* You could use this SQLite engine to create databases and load them with data through the CMD terminal
