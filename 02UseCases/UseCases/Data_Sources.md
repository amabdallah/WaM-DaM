## Data Sources

First, we compiled all the data into CSV files under four Excel workbooks where each workbook has spreadsheets that replicate WaM-DaM tables. Then, I wrote a Matlab script to parse and then load data to the WaM-DaM SQLite database. You can use this generic [Matlab script](https://github.com/amabdallah/WaM-DaM/tree/master/03UseCases/MatlabScript) to load your data to an empty SQLite WaM-DaM database. You can use the populated SQLite database along with the  <a href="https://github.com/amabdallah/WaM-DaM/blob/master/docs/SQLite_Instructions.md" target="_blank"> instrcutions </a> on how to set it up to test the use cases below.
