###Use case #5: Where the data came from for an attribute, who reported them, and to what organization the person belongs to, and using what method?  
[Query](https://github.com/amabdallah/WaM-DaM/blob/master/02UseCases/UseCasesDocs/Queries/05SourcesMethodsOrganizationsPeople.sql)   
[Result](https://github.com/amabdallah/WaM-DaM/blob/master/02UseCases/UseCasesDocs/Results/UseCase5.csv)  

The query result shows important metadata to help users understand the source of discrepancy between data values in Use Case#4 so users may realize limitations of data values and follow-up with involved people. Documenting this metadata improves transparency of modeling by providing traceable lineage of used data values especially for controversial water management models as in Draper et al. (2003).
