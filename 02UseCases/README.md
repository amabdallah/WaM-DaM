### Use Cases to Demonstrate the Capabilities and Benefits of WaM-DaM

To test the use cases mentioned in the **WaM-DaM paper**, download this
<a href="https://github.com/amabdallah/WaM-DaM/blob/master/02UseCases/TestUseCases.rar?raw=true" target="_blank"> TestUseCases.rar </a> folder and follow the href="https://github.com/amabdallah/WaM-DaM/blob/master/02UseCases/UseCasesDocs/UseCasePage/SQLite_Instructions.md" target="_blank"> instructions </a>  on how to use SQLite Manager in Mozilla Firefox to execute the SQL queries against the provided populated WaM-DaM database. 

Here we present the six uses cases that demonstrate how WaM-DaM can help users of scientists and practitioners to search for data for their models, keep track of important metadata, and compare similarities and differences across their data. We use diverse water management <a href="https://github.com/amabdallah/WaM-DaM/blob/master/02UseCases/UseCasesDocs/Data_Sources.md" target="_blank"> data sources </a> to demonstrate and verify WaM-DaM capabilities. we used this Matlab Script and Excel Workbooks to load the data into WaM-DaM https://github.com/amabdallah/WaM-DaM/blob/master/03WaM-DaM_Schema/Setup_Your_WaMDaM.md

For each use case, we provide the SQL command that is needed to execute the use case question and then we provide the answer. The reader is encouraged to execute the use case against the populated SQLite WaM-DaM database 
Download one of these pre-populated WaM-DaM SQLite database instance at your convenience and save it to a place that you can later navigate to, like the Desktop    

===========================================================

**Use case # 1:** <a href="https://github.com/amabdallah/WaM-DaM/blob/master/02UseCases/UseCasesDocs/UseCasePage/Use_Case1.md" target="_blank"> What are the required types of water system components and their attributes for a WEAP model? </a>   

**Use case # 2:** <a href="https://github.com/amabdallah/WaM-DaM/blob/master/02UseCases/UseCasesDocs/UseCasePage/Use_Case2.md" target="_blank"> What are the available water system infrastructure components to expand the Lower Bear River Model to the entire Bear River Watershed? </a>   


**Use case # 3:** <a href="https://github.com/amabdallah/WaM-DaM/blob/master/02UseCases/UseCasesDocs/UseCasePage/Use_Case3.md" target="_blank"> How are the water system components physically connected? Show directions of flow </a>  

**Use case # 4:** <a href="https://github.com/amabdallah/WaM-DaM/blob/master/02UseCases/UseCasesDocs/UseCasePage/Use_Case4.md" target="_blank"> What are the data value(s) of an attribute of a system component? </a>  
This use case shows the data values of all the types of data that WaM-DaM supports: Binarys, Parameters, Seasonal Parameters, Text Free, Text Controlled, File Based, Rules, Time Series, TimeSeriesValues, and Multi-Column Array 

**Use case # 5:** <a href="https://github.com/amabdallah/WaM-DaM/blob/master/02UseCases/UseCasesDocs/UseCasePage/Use_Case5.md" target="_blank"> Where the data came from for an attribute, who reported them, and to what organization the person belongs to, and using what method? </a>  

**Use case # 6:** <a href="https://github.com/amabdallah/WaM-DaM/blob/master/02UseCases/UseCasesDocs/UseCasePage/Use_Case6.md" target="_blank"> What are the data and metadata differences between two scenarios? </a>  
This use cases show how WaM-DaM compares the differences in Topology, Metadata, and Data Values between two scenarios of the Lower Bear River model in WEAP.

### Workshop

We demonstrated the first two uses cases in a workshop at the 2014 CUAHSI conference at Tuscaloosa, AL. Here is the detailed instructions of the 20 minutes <a href="https://github.com/amabdallah/WaM-DaM/tree/master/02UseCases/UseCasesDocs/Workshop" target="_blank"> workshop </a>  activity to discover water management data for a WEAP model.
