Here are the SQL scripts that you can use to create a blank WaM-DaM database. The differences among them are minor and technical due to differences in physical data types used by each system.

If you are a beginner, we recommend you to use SQLite because it is very simple to use and set up, doesnâ€™t require a server, and you can use the free Mozilla Firefox Manager to interact with its data.
