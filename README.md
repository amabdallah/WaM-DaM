===========

#### The Water Management Data Model 1.0 (WaM-DaM). 

#### Model Quicker, Publish Faster! 

Water Management Data Model (WaM-DaM) is an information model that is proposed to synthesize and integrate Fragmented and inconsistent water resources management data. The information model aimes to help scientists and water managers organize, query, and interpret their disparate and diverse data to save time plus facilitate modeling.

#### Getting Started witgh WaM-DaM
SQL scripts for generating blank WaM-DaM databases can be downloaded here:
* [Microsoft SQL Server] (https://github.com/amabdallah/WaM-DaM1.0/blob/master/Files/BlankSchemas/WaM-DaM_for_MSSQL.sql)
* [MySQL](https://github.com/amabdallah/WaM-DaM1.0/blob/master/Files/BlankSchemas/WaM-DaM_for_MySQL.sql)
* [PostgreSQL](https://github.com/amabdallah/WaM-DaM1.0/blob/master/Files/BlankSchemas/WaM-DaM_for_PostgreSQL.sql)
* [SQLite](https://github.com/amabdallah/WaM-DaM1.0/blob/master/Files/BlankSchemas/WaM-DaM_for_SQLite.sql)







This work is part of a large cyberinfrastructure project [(CI-WATER)](http://ci-water.org/) to advance water resources modeling that involves Utah State University, Brigham Young University, University of Utah and University of Wyoming.

Please be aware that the earlier design concepts and documnetations have changed significantlry. However, the spirt of WaM-DaM and its priciples remain the same. You may check earlier documentations here at [WaM-DaM0.1](https://github.com/amabdallah/WaMDaM
)

#### Publications:
A preliminary WaM-DaM design was published in 2014 as a peer-reviewd conference paper:
[WaM-DaM:A Data Model to Organize and Synthesize Water Management Data](http://www.iemss.org/sites/iemss2014/papers/iemss2014_submission_406.pdf)
