===========

#### The Water Management Data Model 1.0 (WaM-DaM). 

#### Model Quicker, Publish Faster! 

Water Management Data Model (WaM-DaM) is an information model that is proposed to synthesize and integrate Fragmented and inconsistent water resources management data. The information model aimes to help scientists and water managers organize, query, and interpret their disparate and diverse data to save time plus facilitate modeling.

Check out WaM-DaM documentation and development at the GitHub Wiki

Check out the current WaM-DaM logical data model [schema](http://amabdallah.github.io/WaM-DaM1.0/

Please be aware that the earlier design concepts and documnetations have changed significantlry. However, the spirt of WaM-DaM and its priciples remain the same.


#### Publications:
A priliminary WaM-DaM design was published in 2014 as a peer-reviewd conference paper:
[WaM-DaM:A Data Model to Organize and Synthesize Water Management Data](http://www.iemss.org/sites/iemss2014/papers/iemss2014_submission_406.pdf)
