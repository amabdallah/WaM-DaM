WaM-DaM
===========

#### The Water Management Data Model (WaM-DaM). 

Water Management Data Model (WaM-DaM) is a persistent information model Organize and Synthesize Disparate Systems Water Management Data. The information model aimes to help scientists and water managers organize, search, discover, and interpret their disparate and diverse data to save time plus facilitate modeling.

#### Getting Started with WaM-DaM
 
SQL scripts for generating blank WaM-DaM databases can be downloaded here:
* [Microsoft SQL Server] (https://github.com/amabdallah/WaM-DaM1.0/blob/master/Files/BlankSchemas/WaM-DaM_for_MSSQL.sql)
* [MySQL](https://github.com/amabdallah/WaM-DaM1.0/blob/master/Files/BlankSchemas/WaM-DaM_for_MySQL.sql)
* [PostgreSQL](https://github.com/amabdallah/WaM-DaM1.0/blob/master/Files/BlankSchemas/WaM-DaM_for_PostgreSQL.sql)
* [SQLite](https://github.com/amabdallah/WaM-DaM1.0/blob/master/Files/BlankSchemas/WaM-DaM_for_SQLite.sql)

Check out the [Instructions](https://github.com/amabdallah/WaM-DaM/blob/master/docs/SQLiteInstructions%20.md) on how set up a WaM-DaM database in SQLite.

#### Publications:
A preliminary WaM-DaM design was published in 2014 as a peer-reviewd conference paper:
[WaM-DaM:A Data Model to Organize and Synthesize Water Management Data](http://www.iemss.org/sites/iemss2014/papers/iemss2014_submission_406.pdf)

This WaM-DaM project is funded as part of the CI-Water Project. An interdisciplinary team of Utah and Wyoming researchers has received a $6 million, three-year award from the National Science Foundation (NSF) to develop a better understanding of the interconnectivity of natural and human water resources systems â€“ a critical environmental sustainability problem facing both Western states.

The award will allow the team of researchers to develop high-performance computer modeling and computational resources (known as cyberinfrastructure or CI for short) to simulate and study how factors such as population growth, shifting land uses and climate variability will impact water storage and availability in the Intermountain West. This award is made under the NSF Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), which supports states' efforts to enhance research, science and mathematics education, and workforce development.

The CI-WATER project includes researchers from Brigham Young University, the University of Utah, Utah State University, and the University of Wyoming. BYU and the University of Wyoming are the lead institutions for their respective states in the consortium.

This work is part of a large cyberinfrastructure project [(CI-WATER)](http://ci-water.org/) to advance water resources modeling that involves Utah State University, Brigham Young University, University of Utah and University of Wyoming.
