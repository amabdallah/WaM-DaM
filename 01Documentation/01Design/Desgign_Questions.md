#### Important design questions 

**i.Integrate disparate water management data for the Bear River Basin, Utah to search and discover data universally**
This use case is demonstrated by searching data across the sources from questions 1 to 10. These questions are organized from generic in asking about water system components, their connectivity, metadata, and specific asking about attribute data values. This use case demonstrates how the users can use WaM-DaM to generate a synthetic view of the data available within a watershed, organize various different data types (e.g., time series, parameters) with appropriate metadata, identify discrepancies among data sources and consider them in preparing a model input data, track data provenance (e.g., sources, methods), relate synonymous data by overcoming sematic heterogeneity, identify relationship between nodes and links, organize models structures of object and their attributes
