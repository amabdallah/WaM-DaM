## Limitations of current WaM-DaM design (draft)

### Overall limitations 
The design of WaM-DaM is based on experience drawn from the thirty reviewed water data systems, five used data sources, six demonstrated use cases, personal experiance, and time spent.

Additional data sources and models to further test WaM-DaM capabilities and improve its design. 

We developed limited lists of controlled vocabularies and ontology for water resources management data (as examples). 

Users experiances, opnions, and feedback are needed to reflect on a broader and more robust design. Hold workshoops and surveys 

Only people with database knowledge or experiance can interact with WaM-DaM. To expose WaM-DaM to the public, frindly user interfaces are badly needed. 

### Technical Design Limitations  
Future work can implement software business rules to maintain the integrity of network connectivity by enforcing the rules above. A link instance can have vertices to allow virtual discretizing of the same link to follow geo-referenced representation on of points along the link. Additional software business rules on connections can constraint what Object Types can connect with what node Object Types. For example, a “wastewater pipe” link Object Type can only connect to a list of node Object Types like a house node, but it cannot connect to “drinking water supply” node. 

Future software business rules should also enforce that all instances of the same Object Type have the same set of attributes

WaM-DaM is a first step towrds an internatonal standrard to organize and communicate water resources management data. We invite the readers to engage in further testing to WaM-DaM and provide feedback to improve it. WaM-DaM can serve as a first step towards a standard to organize and communicate systems analysis water management data.
